# reg-puppeteer-demo-with-minio

This is basically a copy of [reg-viz/reg-puppeteer-demo](https://github.com/reg-viz/reg-puppeteer-demo). But it uses Minio instead of AWS S3 which means you won't need an AWS account nor a credit card to test the awesome [reg-viz/reg-suit](https://github.com/reg-viz/reg-suit).

Read [Testing out Visual Testing](https://medium.com/@kenfdev/testing-out-visual-testing-d81d73fcd851) for detailed instructions to get your hands on with `reg-suit`.
